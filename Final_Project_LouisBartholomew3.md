## Final Project, Part III Writeup

# The Unexpected Role of Cars in Public Health

# Notes on Audience

Initially, I was on the fence about whether my audience should be Pittsburgh specific or generalized to the United States. Ultimately, I chose a combination of the two, making the presentation about general trends, then focusing on a specific example of fixing our built environment in LA, then having my call to action be Pittsburgh specific. The format that I chose would lend itself to a national audience as well with some tweaks to the call to action links.

The intended audience that I settled on was health-conscious and sustainability-oriented people. This focus came about as a result of my user research, where each of my three interviewees highlighted the need to make it crystal clear what the connection between cars and poor health outcomes were, as well as actionable calls to action (rather than generic calls of “advocate for better infrastructure”). 


# Summary on Work, Design Decisions and Observations

After completing Part II, my goals going forward were:

Plan on Changing: I want to have more color in final mockups (I kept it black and white for initial mockups). Color can be used to highlight specific trends (like comparing US vs European health and car trends).

Result in Part III: I experimented with steamgraphs to show trends of transportation over time, rather than rely solely on line charts. I also tried out pie charts and slope charts to compare obesity statistics by nation. One challenge I had with slope charts was that any missing data over the time frames made it impossible to show any data on the graph. To work around this, I utilized other datasets to estimate the missing data pieces. I also focused only on specific years, rather than every 10 years (choosing 1960, 1990, and 2020 instead).

Accessibility: Final renderings will include more consistent axis titles and formatting. Some users were confused by lack of clear labeling, which will also be more clear. Captions and explanations can be expanded for a few of the less clear aspects (like explaining key events).

Result in Part III: While I was able to have clear labeling for the obesity graphs, the steam graph was very hard to format. There were only options to format the x axis, so I had to settle for explaining the graph more in-depth in my presentation. I would have liked to experiment with Tableau if I had another chance because it seemed a bit more versatile for certain visualizations.

Veracity: I will shift my final project to focus more on how cars are bad for our health, then move towards all the negative effects (pollution, obesity, heart disease, asthma, etc.) Despite those negative effects, car ownership has grown, with specific events that have contributed to that increase.

Result in Part III: I did shift my focus for my presentation, but focused just on showing obesity trends for sake of time in the presentation and keeping the content more brief. I really enjoyed incorporating elements of urban landscape improvements (the rolling slides that showed changes to an LA road), though I wish I could have figured out how to make such images myself (probably more of a media content class, and certainly more artistry required of me than I currently have!)

Commitment:  Call to action should focus more on how can we stop car growth and move to more healthy modes of travel? Find long-term opportunities to live closer to work, use public transit, biking when able, or walk to work. These actions will improve your health, the health of your family, and that of your community.

Result in Part III: I really tightened up my calls to action, in large part because of the pressure of the presentation. I wanted to keep calls to action brief, targeted, and digestible. I also was inspired by some of my classmates' presentations in how they included clear links to their calls to action, making it even easier for people watching the presentation to follow up with the ideas.


# Further Observations

Going forward, I definitely want to continue experimenting more with Tableau and Flourish, though many of the programs and applications we used are things I want to explore further in the future (Info Gram, Python, Raw Graphs, etc.). I feel much more confident after this class at finding datasets, cleaning them for the purposes of data analysis, and then finding best ways to visualize them and tell a compelling narrative. 

The 1-minute presentation format also helped me narrow my focus and really direct my research. Instead of going into all the health effects of long commutes (lack of sleep and what that does, all physical ailments, and the past events that have led to car-centric infrastructure), I kept my focus on a clear, concise narrative that would be easy to follow for a busy consumer. If I had more time, I would have liked to add one more timeline chart with key events that resulted in increased suburbanization and car usage in the United States (advent of the Federal Housing Administration, the Interstate Highway Act, the bankruptcy of public transit agencies, etc.).
