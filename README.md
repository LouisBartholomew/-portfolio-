# About me
Louis Bartholomew is a 2nd-year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, where he is earning his Master of Science in Public Policy and Management. He is also a Teaching Assistant for Carnegie Mellon graduate classes on Organizational Design and Geographic Information Systems, as well as an after-school math tutor for Pittsburgh students. After attending New York University, where he earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Public Policy with a minor in Business Studies, he taught high school mathematics for two years in Detroit as part of Teach for America. 

His time in Detroit spurred his interest in how public transportation investment and reforming land-use zoning can revitalize and strengthen communities. In his spare time, Louis enjoys biking, boxing, reading fantasy novels, and spending time with friends.

# What I hope to learn
I'm really interested in learning how to break down data in a more easily digestible format and allow others to maniuplate my data visualizations. I hope that the visualization skills I learn will be able to be included in reports and memos that can educate politicians, policymakers and the general public on addressing pressing needs, such as housing affordability, public transportation investment, and economic development.

Here comes the data visualizations! Perhaps something on the need to replace highways with restored, beautiful, integrated neighborhoods? We'll see!

# Part I: Select Visualization

I wanted to examine visualizations relating to federal spending, specifically the breakdown of different programs over time. The visualization I focused on represented total federal spending, broken down into distinct categories, over 5 years including projections (2020 to 2025). The underlying dataset was already relatively simplified, so minimal cleaning was required.

# Part II: Critique the Data Visualization

The intended audience seems to be everyday people, rather than specifically targeted to policy makers. It could be attempting to show to constituents how federal spending is broken down so they can get a sense of spending priorities. The pie chart does communicate a distinct breakdown of spending by programs, but some colors are too close in shade (specifically Defense and Welfare).

While it does show a generally clear breakdown of spending capability, going between years is difficult and results in the audience not being able to compare pie charts between years. This makes examining trends of spending capability across time very difficult.

Readers would be able to understand the breakdown of information, but might mistake the graphic for the federal budget, rather than the federal budget capability of spending. The pie chart does not seem the ideal way to show spending because there are too many categories. Generally, having over 4 or 5 categories is too much for a pie chart and has diminishing returns of understanding for the reader.

The visualization is generally reliable and accurate of the spending capability of the US government. It also includes an interesting and unexplained dip in welfare spending capability that wouldn’t be reflected in budget projections (this is most likely due to the Social Security Trust Fund being projected to run out). Conventional budget projections generally do not take into account this fiscal cliff, and do not represent pension payments as part of federal spending responsibility.

It is relatively easy to infer meaning and clearly communicates its intended message. The only thing that would need to perhaps be explained is the difference between a real budget and spending authority.

There is no reason this visualization needs to be tilted and be in 3-D. This diminishes the relative ability to see the size of further-away slices. The colors are also too close in a few cases, and there is too much text that could potentially confuse the reader. It is not unpleasant to view, but could be represented with simpler, more distinct colors and point to categories in a less condensed way.

I ranked engagement a 6 because while the data is seen on the page, there is no interactivity. It doesn’t allow an audience to hover over categories to further examine them, or click on related articles easily that would delve further into the topic. The surrounding page, like the visualization, is very text heavy and feels busy. The data is easily downloaded, however, but there is no readily available way to share the image with others, perhaps over social media.



## Critique of the Critique Method

This method helped focus and hone my critique of certain elements, especially in terms of putting myself in the shoes of the intended audience. As a policymaker, I look at this visualization and can infer a great deal, but thinking from the perspective of someone who might not be steeped in the data, this visualization did have key deficiencies in terms of understanding long-term projections and distinguishing between colors.

One additional measure I would include is accessibility; are readers who are perhaps colorblind going to be able to view this easily (especially when defense and welfare are so close to the same green color). 

One recommendation for this visualization I would have is to change it from a pie chart to something that shows trends over time, such as a line or bar chart. I'm not exactly sure what this would look like, but will delve more into exact design in the mock up phase.


# Part III: Wireframe a Solution

My first possible solution above attempted to show fewer spending categories (just over Defense, Welfare, Transportation, Pensions, and Education) in order to not overwhelm the audience with lots of small categories. I also wanted to use the different years’ data that was available to show trends of spending in each category over time.

My second possible solution was a time series line chart showing federal spending over those same 5 categories as an overall percentage of GDP. Similar to the first, I wanted to incorporate a time element to show changes over time, but this time as a ratio with GDP (similar to our previous work of considering GDP-to-Debt ratios). This might be a better way to compare different categories.

## Part IV: Test the Solution

For feedback, I interviewed two people close to me; for the purposes of anonymity, I’ll refer to them as Ayesha and Robert. Ayesha is not usually steeped in policy, so she represented an audience that might be less familiar with reading data visualizations. Robert, on the other hand, is an expert at creating and manipulating data, particularly financial data related to budgets for companies.

My script for both of them consisted of the following questions:

What are the first things you notice about this visualization?
What do you think this visualization is describing?
What is confusing?
Who do you believe the intended audience for this is?
What would you change or do differently?
