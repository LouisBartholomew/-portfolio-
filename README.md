# About me
Louis Bartholomew is a 2nd-year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, where he is earning his Master of Science in Public Policy and Management. He is also a Teaching Assistant for Carnegie Mellon graduate classes on Organizational Design and Geographic Information Systems, as well as an after-school math tutor for Pittsburgh students. After attending New York University, where he earned a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Public Policy with a minor in Business Studies, he taught high school mathematics for two years in Detroit as part of Teach for America. 

His time in Detroit spurred his interest in how public transportation investment and reforming land-use zoning can revitalize and strengthen communities. In his spare time, Louis enjoys biking, boxing, reading fantasy novels, and spending time with friends.

# What I hope to learn
I'm really interested in learning how to break down data in a more easily digestible format and allow others to maniuplate my data visualizations. I hope that the visualization skills I learn will be able to be included in reports and memos that can educate politicians, policymakers and the general public on addressing pressing needs, such as housing affordability, public transportation investment, and economic development.

# Portfolio
Here comes the data visualizations! Perhaps something on the need to replace highways with restored, beautiful, integrated neighborhoods? We'll see!

# Step I: Select Visualization
I wanted to examine visualizations relating to federal spending, specifically the breakdown of different programs over time. The visualization I focused on represented total federal spending, broken down into distinct categories, over 5 years including projections (2020 to 2025). The underlying dataset was already relatively simplified, so minimal cleaning was required.
