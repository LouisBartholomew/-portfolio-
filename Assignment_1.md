# Map for DC Amtrak

For Assignment 1 I wanted to make a map using colors from an Amtrak train, focusing specifically on the DC region (base of operations for Amtrak).

# Choosing the Color Palette

I used the above photo of an Amtrak train that I thought represented the base colors of Amtrak's logo well (Blue, White, and Dark Brown). I then began to tinker with different color combinations in the specifications outlined in the maps creater. 

# Producing the Map Extent

The map created was in line with Amtrak's colors and brand, but some features remain a bit confusing. For instance, water features and parks are a very similar blue, which needs to be addressed. Right now, at a full view of the nation, it looks as if water has infiltrated the core of the continent in many places, which would be very distracting to any reader, let alone anyone less familiar with the country.
