# GIS Portfolio
Welcome to my GIS portfolio for Advanced GIS!

# About me
I love biking, watching urban planning videos, and playing cello in my spare time. Anything map related I'm there for!

My main interest is public transit and policy areas related to it (public housing, community safety, community development, zoning, land-use, and education). My main motivation for working in that field is to help create public transit systems that are more reliable, rapid, and useful for people's everyday lives. I want to help move our cities and suburbs towards having a car-optional and car-restricted attitude, rather than building a built envirornment that demands that each person buy an expensive personal heicle for all daily tasks.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to delve more into depth in GIS and find out how to represent data in a more versatile way across the areas of public transportation that will help inform long-term planning of routes and short-term investments in increases of service along certain corridors. Specifically, I'm interested in using GIS to map where people go (from home to work) in order to better inform route adjustments and schedule enhancements.
