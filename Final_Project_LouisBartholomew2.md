## The Hidden Costs of Rising Car Usage

Our choices of how we travel may seem to be inconsequential on a daily basis, but have a huge impact on our collective health as a society. 
Cars in particular have many hidden effects. 

For the past 70 years, car usage and ownership has skyrocketed in America by over 450%! This has come at the expense of other modes of travel.

For comparison, car ownership and usage in other countries grew nowhere near the same rate:

Obesity rates have, at the same time, also begun increasing as Americans changed their travel habits from more mobile to more sedentary modes of travel.

Key events have played a role in perpetuating and growing America’s appetite for cars. By building more freeways to accommodate what we saw as organic 
growth in car usage, we inadvertently encouraged car usage to the detriment of walking, cycling, and public transit usage, a concept called “induced demand.


# Call to Action

To combat these trends, I urge each of you, even if you drive most of the time, to examine your transportation habits: if you’re driving, is there any 
scenario in which you would take a bus or bike? What is missing that would enable you to make the switch? Please follow MoveForwardPGH to learn more about 
specific ways you can support all modes of transit in our city, rather than just cars.
