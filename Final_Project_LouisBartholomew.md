# Executive Summary

Drawing on data on Americans’ transportation habits and changing levels of obesity, I want to create a graph that shows the relationship between these two variables (centering on Americans’ changing relationship to cars and public transit usage). I will then highlight key policy events that contributed to the acceleration or continuation of car-centric development and the further collective deterioration of American health.


# Project Structure

Open with initial observation: “Our choices of how we travel may seem to be inconsequential on a daily basis, but have a huge impact on our collective health as a society.”

Initial DataViz: Initial levels of travel by category shown on graph at 1960, then revealed gradually until present day (showing vast increase in car miles driven, plummeting train and bus usage). Next line is introduced that shows obesity levels over same period of time. Key events animated (Interstate Highway Act, the bankruptcy of streetcar lines in US cities, city bankruptcies, forcing cut back of services to paltry levels). Wait 5 seconds.

“Key events have played a role in perpetuating and growing America’s appetite for cars. By building more freeways to accomodate what we saw as organic growth in car usage, we inadvertently encouraged car usage to the detriment of walking, cycling, and public transit usage, a concept called “induced demand.” 

“To combat these trends, I urge each of you, even if you drive most of the time, to examine your transportation habits: if you’re driving, is there any scenario in which you would take a bus or bike? What is missing that would enable you to make the switch? Please follow MoveForwardPGH to learn more about specific ways you can support all modes of transit in our city, rather than just cars.”

## Data Sources

Cheryl D. Fryar, M.S.P.H., Margaret D. Carroll, M.S.P.H., and Joseph Afful, M.S. “Prevalence of Overweight, Obesity, and Severe Obesity Among Adults Aged 20 and Over: United States, 1960–1962 Through 2017–2018.” Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, 2018.

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/obesity-adult-17-18/obesity-adult.htm#Tables


In this study, the authors examine levels of obesity in adults over a 60-year time period. They break their findings down by race, gender, class, and geographic location. For the purposes of my final project, I will be using their aggregate data (overall obesity rates) to show that American society has become increasingly unhealthy since 1960.



“US Passenger Miles.” US Bureau of Transportation, 2021.

https://www.bts.gov/content/us-passenger-miles


This dataset shows US passenger miles (in millions) of Americans each year, meaning the total miles traveled by all Americans by different transport modes. I will center on the increase in miles traveled by light vehicles (personal automobiles), the plummeting levels of train miles traveled in the postwar period (and its subsequent stabilization), and the steady decline of all other modes of public transit.


## Method and Medium

I plan on completing this project using Esri’s Story Maps, embedded with a Flourish or Tableau visualization. Given the time constraint of the presentation, I will include no more than 2 visualizations to show and discuss. I will either create 1 visualization with both trends and key events (increasing car usage and increasing obesity) or 2 visualizations that show trends, then key events overlaid in the second one. 

I will edit and modify the Project Structure (see above) to ensure that each word is necessary and advances the story I want to tell for the audience. I will time myself in this portion so I don’t go over time and am effective, concise, and clear in my presentation of the visuals.
